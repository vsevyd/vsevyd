### Hi there, I'm Vsevyd! 👋

**Technical Project Manager | Industrial Engineer transforming into GameDev**

I spent 20+ years ensuring that critical industrial systems (Linux, Hardware) run without failure. Now, I apply that same discipline, system thinking, and reliability engineering to **Game Development** and **Digital Products**.

### 🧠 My Engineering Philosophy

<details>
<summary><b>Why Industrial Experience matters in GameDev? (Click to expand)</b></summary>
<br>
In industrial automation, the cost of an error is critical. There is no "hotfix" for a melted cable or a stopped conveyor belt. I bring this mindset to software development:

* **Risk Management:** I anticipate bottlenecks before they block the pipeline.
* **System Thinking:** I don't just look at the feature; I look at how it affects the whole ecosystem.
* **Documentation:** If it's not written down, it doesn't exist. I treat documentation as part of the product code.

<summary><b>My Transition Story: From Hardware to Software</b></summary>
<br>
After a successful career in Ukraine as an Electromechanical Engineer (Office Technician), I relocated to **Barcelona, Spain**.

This move was a catalyst for professional evolution. I decided to convert my hobby (TTRPGs, Worldbuilding) into a profession, backed by hard technical skills (Node.js, Docker, Git). I am not a junior developer; I am a senior engineer learning a new stack.

### 🚀 Featured Project: [Character Generator](https://github.com/vsevyd/character-generator)

> *A data-driven simulation engine for TTRPGs (OSR & PbtA).*

**The Challenge:** Standard randomizers create "chaos".
**The Solution:** I built a sociological engine using **Matrix Logic** (Estate × Class) and **Power Law** demographics.

* **Architecture:** Monorepo with Clean Architecture (Facade & Singleton patterns).
* **Tech:** Node.js, Docker, JSON-based Data Layer.
* **Status:** Active Development (Implementing React Frontend).
